In this project, I implemented a Spring Boot-based CRUD application to manage job notifications for trainers. The system allows users to create, view, and delete job notifications via RESTful API endpoints. The key components of the project include a JobNotification model, a JobNotificationService class for business logic, a JobRepository for database interactions, and a JobNotificationController to expose RESTful APIs. MySQL database was used for testing the CRUD operations.
